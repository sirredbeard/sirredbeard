I am currently the senior open source community manager at [Determined AI](https://www.determined.ai/https:/) and [Pachyderm](https://pachyderm.io/), upstream open source AI/ML projects supported by HPE AI.

Prior to my work on AI/ML at HPE, I was a senior engineering manager at [Rancher Labs](https://www.rancher.com/), where I focused on internal DevOps, support for Windows Containers on Kubernetes, and documentation.

Before that, I was a developer advocate at Canonical where I focused on Ubuntu on Windows Subsystem for Linux.

I have experience in:

* building and leading effective results-oriented community teams
* building and leading groundbreaking engineering teams
* Windows dev and administration
* Linux dev and administration
* DevOps and MLOps
* containers, Kubernetes, virtualization
* with open source compliance and supply chain security
