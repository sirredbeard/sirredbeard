# Hayden Barnes

Hello! I am Hayden Barnes. I am a community manager and experienced engineering manager on open source projects.

I have a passion for open-source code, [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://github.com/sirredbeard/awesome-wsl), and old [UNIX](https://github.com/sirredbeard/awesome-unixhttps:/).

I [blog](https://boxofcables.dev/https:/), write [books](https://www.amazon.com/Windows-Subsystem-Linux-Cross-Platform-Collaboration/dp/1484268725/https:/), speak at conferences, and guest on a variety of podcasts and streams.

You can also find me at [Twitter](https://x.com/unixterminalhttps:/) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thbarnes).

## Work

I am current the senior open source community manager at [Determined AI](https://www.determined.ai/https:/) and [Pachyderm](https://pachyderm.io/https:/), upstream open source AI/ML projects supported by HPE AI.

Prior to my work on AI/ML at HPE, I was a senior enginering manager at [Rancher Labs](https://www.rancher.com/https:/), where I focused on internal DevOps, support for Windows Containers on Kubernetes, and documentation.

Before that, I was a developer advocate at Canonical where I focused on Ubuntu on Windows Subsystem for Linux.
